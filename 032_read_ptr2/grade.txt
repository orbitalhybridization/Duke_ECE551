Attempting to compile test.c
gcc -Wall -Wextra --pedantic --std=gnu99 test.c -o test
compiled
I expected to find a file called 'answer.txt' but it did not exist
(or was not a regular file)
Here are the files that I can find:
answers.txt
Makefile
#Makefile#
README
test
test.c
Your output did not match what we expected.

Overall Grade: FAILED
